# Functional traits predict coexistence under changing climate
Here are the data and R codes used in Lyu & Alexander (2024). Functional traits predict outcomes of current and novel competition under warmer climate. Global Change Biology (accepted). A full-text is availalbe on BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.26.615168


R codes used for population modelling and coexstence analyses can be found in:  Lyu, S. and J. M. Alexander (2023).
