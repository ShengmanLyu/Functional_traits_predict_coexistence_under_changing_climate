# Functional traits predict coexistence under changing climate
Here are the data and R codes used in the manuscript: Lyu &amp; Alexander, Functional traits predict outcomes of current and novel competition under warmer climate (under review)

R codes used for population modelling and coexstence analyses can be found in:  Lyu, S. and J. M. Alexander (2023). "Compensatory responses of vital rates attenuate impacts of competition on population growth and promote coexistence." Ecology Letters 26(3): 437-447. https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14167
