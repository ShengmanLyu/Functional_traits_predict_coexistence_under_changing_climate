# Functional traits predict coexistence under changing climate
Here are the data and R codes used in Lyu & Alexander (2024). Functional traits predict outcomes of current and novel competition under warmer climate. Global Change Biology. A full text is availalbe on BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.26.615168

Detailed information on population modelling and coexistence analyses is avaialbe in: Lyu, S. and J. M. Alexander (2023). "Compensatory responses of vital rates attenuate impacts of competition on population growth and promote coexistence." Ecology Letters 26(3): 437-447. https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14167 R codes for population modelling and coexistence analyses are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ShengmanLyu/Compensatory_Responses_and_species_coexistence.git 

### There are four data and R script files:
#### Coexistence.csv 
> This file includes the estimated outcomes of competition, relative fitness differences and niche overlap.

#### NICH_coexistence-traits.R
> R scripts for statistical analyses and data visualisation (Figures 1-3 in the main text).

#### Population growth.csv
> This file includes the estimated invasion population growth rates.

#### Trait.csv
> This file includes 15 traits of the studied species that were measured at each site.
