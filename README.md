# Functional traits predict coexistence under changing climate
Here are the data and R codes used in Lyu & Alexander (2024). Functional traits predict outcomes of current and novel competition under warmer climate. *Global Change Biology*. A full text is available on BioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.26.615168 Each data file has an attached Metadata sheet explaining the variables.

#### Demography data_raw.xlsx
> The file includes the raw demographic data used to parameterize integral projection models. 

#### Population growth.xlsx
> This file includes the estimated invasion population growth rates. The estimated population growth rates can also be computed using the raw demographic data. Detailed information on population modeling and coexistence analyses is available in: Lyu, S. and J. M. Alexander (2023). "Compensatory responses of vital rates attenuate impacts of competition on population growth and promote coexistence." *Ecology Letters* 26(3): 437-447. https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14167 R codes for population modeling and coexistence analyses are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ShengmanLyu/Compensatory_Responses_and_species_coexistence.git 

#### Coexistence.xlsx
> This file includes the estimated outcomes of competition, relative fitness differences and niche overlap.

#### Trait data_raw.xlsx, Trait.xlsx
The files include the raw and organized trait data. The organized version includes 15 traits averaged for each species at each site.

#### NICH_coexistence-traits.R
> R scripts for statistical analyses and data visualization (Figures 1-3 in the main text).
